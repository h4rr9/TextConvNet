# TextConvNet

a convolutional neural network for text classification based on "A Sensitivity Analysis of (and Practitionersâ€™ Guide to) Convolutional
Neural Networks for Sentence Classification" and "Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification"

## Datasets

The polarity, subjectivity datasets by Pang/Lee and the SST binary dataset were used to train the model

## Word2vec

place the Google News word2vec binary file in /data/word2vec/ (change the file name in preprocessing files)
